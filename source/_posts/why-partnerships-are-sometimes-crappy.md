Ah, partnerships. Joint ventures in which people pool their resources together to achieve a business goal. 

I believe partnerships can be good as long as the responsibilities of each partner is spelled out in a contract. 

Often, people may say, "We don't need contracts. All I need you to do is trust me". I disagree with this statement because it requires business partners to expose financial vulnerabilities to each other. With a contract, trust is not necessary and expectations are set in proverbial stone. This is why I like them. People tend to 'forget' less when their word is written down.
