A transistor is the basic building block of a CPU. It represents a binary value of either 0 or 1. The value is called a bit. 

If a current passes through the transistor, it is turned on and represents 1. If it no current passes, it is turned off and represents 0. 

Transistors which are grouped together are called logic gates.
